# Alternative Damage Types & Calculations

### Ability Damage
- Primarily scales with Intelligence.
- Affected by specific item multipliers (e.g., Wither Impact).
- Can be boosted by certain armor sets (e.g., Storm's Armor).
- Does not typically use Strength or Weapon Damage in its formula.

### Damage over Time (DoT)
- Sources: Fire Aspect, Venom's Touch enchantments, Scorpion Foil, etc.
- Damage is dealt in ticks over a duration.
- Scaling can vary based on the source.

### Unique Formula Modifiers
- **One For All:** Removes most additive multipliers (like Sharpness) in exchange for a large base weapon damage boost.
- **First Strike:** A multiplicative bonus applied only to the first hit on a mob.
- **Soul Eater:** A multiplicative bonus that scales with mobs killed.
